# ProjectEulerRuby

Just like it says, these are the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, solved in Ruby.

This is less about solving the Project Euler problems than it is about getting familiar with Ruby and learning deeper parts of the language than [the Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) taught.
